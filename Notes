7 tables with statistical data: mean, median, Q1, Q2, Q3, sd. 
Or we can also do all in one table. 
With 1 row for each indicator and columns for each statistical metric.  

7 graphs of evolution (basically line charts).
7 histograms
1 heatmap with all indicators

If we have some variables that have a different time scale, we do two heatmaps. 
7 box plots with comments. 

Extra scatter plot with the results of the predictions.
